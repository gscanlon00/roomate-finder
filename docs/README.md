All of your documentation should be placed in subdirectories of this directory.

* Use the `1-proposal` sub-directory for your project proposal.
* Use the `2-functional-specification` sub-directory for your functional specification.
* Use the `3-final-reports` sub-directory for your video walk through, user manual and technical documentation.

There are additional instructions in each of those sub-directories.  Please read them.

Excluding the proposal document (and the video walkthrough), the general rule of thumb that you should
adopt is that documents should be converted to PDF when finalised - and
available for collection from your repo in time for the appropriate deadlines.

While templates are provided in MS Word format, individual students may select
whichever editing software they prefer - the only constraint is that
the final revision of these documents should be converted to PDF.
